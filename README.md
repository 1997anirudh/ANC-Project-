# ANC-Project- 

This is EEE511 Final project code implementation. This is an accident severity prediction project that has been implemented various machine learning models. The notebooks are included to carry out respective parts of the project. They include exploratory data analysis, baseline models, neural structured learning and hummingbird. Neural Structured Learning and Hummingbird are novel methods integrated into the accident domain. These notebooks can be run locally using Jupyter Notebook or using Google Colab. Code has been annotated to make it easy to understand.
